Hello! 

Here you will find my app that was created for the Blck Bx technical challenge. 

First, set up the express API on port localhost:3000. To do so, enter into the src folder, and then cd into fizzbuzzAPI. Enter node app.js into the terminal.

Then, load the main page of the app on localhost:3001. In order to do so, cd into the main folder of the repository and run the command npm start in the terminal. This should render the main page of the app.

Once these commands are complete, simply press the button, and the list of numbers should appear.
